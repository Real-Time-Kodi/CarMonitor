# CarMonitor
used to monitor vairous parts of the car through an arduino

don't use this yet  
if you do decide to use it, clone it to /opt/CarMonitor and run install.sh as root  
this will install it as a system service and start it by default

hardcoded to work from /opt/CarMonitor  
hardcoded to work with /dev/ttyACM0  
this will only work with the as of right now unreleased arduino firmware  
edit monitor.py to change these
